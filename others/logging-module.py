'''
Logging module provides a flexible framework
for emitting log messages from Python programs.
This module is widely used by libraries and is
the first go-to point for most programmers when
it comes to logging.
'''

# Five standard logging levels:
# DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

# INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.

# WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.

# ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.

# CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
